# What is this repository for?
It is meant to give people who start learning Python some real world exercises on different topics.

# How to start learning?
- Clone the repository
- Create your own branch from master branch
- Each topic has an `exercise.py` file in it, in which student can find some real world examples.
- Duplicate that file and add your surname at the end of the file name.
- Each example is wrapped into a function, each function has a piece of code, which looks like the following line:
    `>>> some_code(args)`. This is a special `pydoctest` syntax, which controls, whether your function is written correctly.
    Some exercises require to change the function, so that all tests pass, some function require to add some tests.
- To check, whether an exercise is done correctly, start the module and see, whether the output shows the errors in the 
    exercise or not.

# How to send your results for checking
If all tests pass, simply create a pull request into `solved` branch and I will check it.
